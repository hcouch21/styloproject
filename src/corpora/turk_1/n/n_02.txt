She doesn't deny these behaviors, but always has a justification for her actions. 
Group 1 (PM) – Joey is a high functioning Autistic student. He is in the 2nd grade. He has great difficulty transitioning from school to home, often refusing to get out of the care and/or enter his classroom. When he does enter his classroom, he has a great deal of difficulty following the established morning routine (sharpening his pencils, hanging up his coat, stowing his bag, completing a math problem of the day etc. )
Group 2 (PM) – Kelsey is a 4th grader with ADHD. She is unmedicated due to family resistance. School OT staff report that she has a high need for movement in her schedule. She seems in constant motion. Accommodations such as a wiggle seat and bungie cords have helped, but her behavior is still negatively impacting her peer's ability to focus and learn. 
Group 3 (PM) – Jake is a 5th grader with Asperger's Syndrome. He has made gains in his social skills over the years, but he continues to have no true friends. Once tolerant students, are becoming tired of his butting into private conversations, intruding in games and tattling. 
Group 4 (PM) – Emma is a kindergarten student  who turned 5 on October 1st. She entered kindergarten with an IEP from CDS under the category of Developmental Delay. She also received Speech and Language, OT and PT services. She presents as both young and you suspect her to have skill deficits in the litteracy areas. When centers are introduced she frequently refuses and goes to play with the classroom doll house. When redirected she throws a tantrum (yelling and stomping her feet) before melting down completely, crying inconsolably and refusing to get up off of the floor. She ends up spending a great deal of academic time resting in the classroom library. 
Group 5 (PM) – Bella is a 3rd grader who is hyperfocused on making friendships. She is so involved in this task that she can not maintain her focus on academics. She frequently blurts out during instructional times to tell her peers what they should be doing and when. When she can't seem to form the friendships that she desires, she forces the students to become friends with her via typical bullying behaviors. 
Group 6 (PM) – Edward is a 4th grader who has difficulty persisting on academic tasks that are beyond his perceived skill level. Though he is capable of doing most tasks that his teacher assigns, when he doesn't meet with immediate success, he refuses to try. It takes a great deal of teacher prodding to get him to complete any work that doesn't come very easily to him.
