Wechsler Intelligence Scale For Children – Fourth Edition
The Wechsler Intelligence Scale For Children – Fourth Edition is a series of individually administered tasks that evaluate a student’s Full-Scale IQ. Individual tests are grouped into four categories of cognitive ability. A student’s Full-Scale IQ is a general estimate of that student’s abilities and is one factor in predicting school success. Many other factors beside general cognitive ability, such as motivation, overall health, a supportive home environment, and general temperament also contribute to a student’s success in school. As in any other activity, performance may vary from day to day and that variation may sometimes be significant. 
Composites are in boldface type.
