Segal says that adults can form healthy bonds by learning to forgive and relinquish grudges (2010.) This is something I am working on and getting better at everyday. I used to think about all the reasons I hated my mother and blame her for my life’s problems on a daily basis. I would be lying if I said I never did that anymore but I have cut it down to a few times a week.
	I know that because of the way I was raised I over compensate with my own children. I coddle them and smother them with affection and praise. While I know that my children feel loved I also know that they are spoiled. I am trying to work on this as I think that over compensating will cause problems for them later on in life.
	My goals today are to find a balance in my life. I need to be a good mother, spouse, and hopefully be successful in my business endeavors. I also need to find peace inside and allow my emotional scars to heal. I may be developing slower than others socially and emotionally but I am confident that I will get there someday. I can learn from my past and be a better person for it. I know that I will not make the mistakes my mother did and I also know that with the patience of my family and friends I will learn to trust and be happy with who I am today. We all have pasts that have affected us in some way, but learning from them makes us who we are in the end.
