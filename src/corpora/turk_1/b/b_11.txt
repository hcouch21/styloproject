 Salary
The salary of a money manager can vary greatly and is more often than not based on the performance level of the employee and portfolio. Individual money managers normally charge a percentage of the value of the account. A typical percentage is one percent for accounts under the million dollar mark. Raising a portfolios worth can greatly raise a manager’s personal salary and consequently falls back on performance and drive. 
Working for a state or government agency pays anywhere from $80,000 to $160,000 on the average. Some states may pay less or more and normally starting salary is based on experience. This means that the longer a manager stays with the branch and the better they perform the more money they can personally make.
