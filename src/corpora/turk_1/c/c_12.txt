	Minor portrayals of Canadians show excessive cleanliness in speech and naivete in attitude.  A British man displays a droll sense of humor, and is associated with homosexuality, though feigned.  These representations indicate a perception that the rest of the English-speaking world is somehow less “manly” than America.
	Other than the single South Asian character, racial minorities are nonexistent in these programs despite three of them taking place in urban environments.  However, there were not enough supporting characters to draw any conclusions about main versus supporting roles.

Overall Depictions of Sex / Gender
	Women are portrayed as passive characters, while men are seen as active agents of change in their lives and those of women.  Females are made to seem incapable of making difficult decisions, or of defining their relationships instead of simply accepting or rejecting the scenarios offered them by men.  Events and emotions are external forces exerted on women, instead of objects to be handled and controlled by them.
The two exceptions to this are Donna from “That ‘70s Show,” and Mimi from “The Drew Carey Show.”  Donna does show initiative, but it is not in a context involving relationships with men, and she is depicted as something of a tomboy.  Mimi, however, is only shown as independent by the force of her malice.   Both cases indicate a view that strong women are either unfeminine or malignant.  Women who are not intentionally shown as ugly or obese are all unusually beautiful, with little or no plain-looking women.
Men are seen as obsessed with sex, prone to immature or self-destructive behavior, and often act without thinking.  They take things less seriously than situations merit, and seek to define their relationships as they see fit.  Male attitudes are shown as aggressive, probing, and goal-oriented.  Even George Costanza in “Seinfeld,” a character with very little power over his life, is shown actively taking measures to control the course of his relationship.
Shows targeted toward women appear to involve more talk than action, and the humor revolves around expressive or emotional topics.  Even these depict women as complacent and indecisive, though they focus on different aspects of male behavior than shows meant for a male audience.  Sitcoms geared for female sensibilities hint at men’s preoccupation with sex, whereas those with a male audience typically wallow in it. 
*Percentages are rounded to the nearest tenth.
Overall Sex / Gender (Total): 35.7% Female.  64.3% Male.
Overall Sex / Gender (Main): 36% Female.  64% Male. 
Overall Sex / Gender (Supporting): 33.3% Female.  66.7% Male.
Overall Depictions of Social Class
	Money is not an apparent issue for any of the characters in the four sitcoms studied.  George Costanza in “Seinfeld” is unemployed and lives with his parents, yet can afford to take his girlfriend out for a lobster dinner.
