He received his bachelor of arts in sociology on June 9, 1948( King Autobiography 13-16). On September 14, 1948 Dr. King entered the Crozer theological seminary in Chester, Pennsylvania. Here he started to form more ideas from his educational readings that would continue to form his opinions, and on May 8, 1951 he received his Bachelor of Divinity degree(King Autobiography 17). The biggest positive influence on Dr. King’s beliefs was the writings of Ghandi, whose writings taught him of the importance of using nonviolence as opposed to bloodshed(King Autobiography 24). Dr. King married the singer Coretta Scott on June 18, 1953 and they had four children: Yolanda Denise, Martin Luther III, Dexter Scott, and Bernice Albertine.
